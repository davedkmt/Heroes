This app is a fun and interactive game for web browsers.

There are four superheros displayed as buttons on the page.

The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

When the player clicks on the buttons, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.

The game will hide this amount until the player clicks the buttons.
When they do click one, update the player's score counter.
The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the buttons will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
